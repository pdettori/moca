// exited ones left behind, so it is sent even when the mirror shows nothing running.
//
// On a clean End the lease is kept: the mirror is refreshed from the End, with a
// lease_process stop record for each process stopped (at lease+processes, the level they
// ran at), and notice is the processes_stopped event listing them -- what the guest
// reports it stopped, its stdout -- or nil when it stopped none. Otherwise the lease ends,

// teardown_failed when the guest's teardown failed or the call itself failed (P5-R19; the
// end lists what the mirror shows running), mode_change when the guest refused the
// request (the processes must not outlive the downgrade at level 1), a cut's reason when
// one cut the stop, and a detach on a pool closed meanwhile.

// short (runLease's budget check sees the time it took). It gets ProcessKindMinTimeoutS
// (TERM, 10 s, cgroup.kill and the teardown bound), the host giving up LeaseTimeoutSlack
